# AnalogDevices Summer School 2023

This is a repository for the Analog Devices summer school 2023.
We made a accelerometer application from designing the schematics to writing the code for the application.
We used a ADXL327 as an accelerometer and an AD5592R as the ADC.
Using KiCad we designed the schematics for this project as well as the layout.
The linux drivers were written in C, and the applications in C and in Python.
